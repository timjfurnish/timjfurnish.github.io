	["Chapter 1"]:{title:"A Calling", text:"It wasn’t the best of times. It wasn’t the worst of times. My life was what you could call fine. A pessimist might say mediocre; an optimist, perfectly reasonable. It was, for all intents and purposes, alright.|“Dad, soldering iron! Thank you.”|However, and this is a big however, while the ripe old age of middle had treated me adequately it had not done wonders for my relationship with my daughter Kira. She — headstrong and wise beyond her years — and I — busy and often creaky — had been communicating less with each passing month. I could tell she was gearing up to make her own way in the world. She mentioned it a <i>lot</i>.|A shared passion for outlandish inventions did its best to tether her life to mine. I knew it couldn’t keep her around forever but if it bought me even a little extra time in her periodically delightful company I’d take it.|It was a pastime — a calling, even — that I’d picked up from my own father. (I don’t fully understand the mechanism by which parental hobbies are inherited alongside eye colour and hairline; had we been geneticists rather than engineers that may have been different.)|“Think that should hold. Is that paper in properly? Then why’s the camera not locking on? This is precisely why I said we should get a new lens. I told you this one was scratched. Feed it a file instead. I’ve got some on this thing if you need one.”|When I wasn’t inventing at home or pouring my daylight hours into my job I dreamed of adventure. Fortunately, the adventures stayed within the boundaries of my unconscious mind; my joints had started aching and I was settled into a thoroughly manageable routine, thank you very much.|“Ok, so it can’t read files. And I’ve wiped the lens but now the page flipper’s jamming so it can’t do paper either. Maybe we should… wait! It was misaligned! Pass me the rest. I’m going to lean a chair on it so it doesn’t move about any more.”|The universe, however, does not have a great track record when it comes to playing along with its occupants’ desires for stability. Maybe it fears that constancy leads to stagnation. The universe, I find, has much the same personality as a bored teenager — regularly reinventing itself, rearranging its bedroom furniture or upending its perfectly functional laws of thermodynamics rather than carry on looking or living or operating like <i>this</i> any longer, <i>ugh</i>.|It stands to reason that a universe can break a whole bunch of foundation-level rules that its denizens cannot; that’s certainly the case in most organisations. It would also explain the existence of black holes, time dilation, the double slit experiment and car keys which sit patiently by your front door for days but then relocate to an upstairs drawer the second you need to drive somewhere.|“There we go! Can we tell if it’s working or do we need to wait until it’s done? Really? Where? Ah, yeah! Look at that! Right, let’s leave it running and get going.”|There was a time when the universe and I got on just fine. When all I had to worry about was my career at the lab and my wonderful daughter and the potentially deadly work assignment I’d been handed. You know — small stuff.|“Dad, come on! I don’t want to miss the table and we can talk about what we’re going to build next.”|And then it all went a bit &lt;translation not found&gt;."},
	["Chapter 2"]:{title:"Really Minor Gods With Soldering Irons", text:"Dougie was not, it has to be said, as natural an engineer as my daughter. Not that I’d ever have told him as much. Not unless I was particularly frustrated with his work.|“Dougie! Goodness’ sake, you hopeless, feckless waste of a salary and quite a lot of breathable air, my daughter’s a better engineer than you and she’s still in school. What the hell is this?”|Fine, maybe I told him every so often.|Dougie shrugged. He didn’t need to answer. It was a blinking red light. We could both see that.|I deactivated the device that we were meant to have perfected a week earlier and the lamp in question stopped flashing. (This was not the point at which the laws of physics went all wonky. This was the expected outcome.)|Still saying nothing, Dougie — a being seemingly made entirely from long, wavy white hair, a furrowed brow and a singed lab coat — returned to his spreadsheets. He always seemed more comfortable there than up to his elbows in circuits and supercooled semiconductors. He liked the safety net of an undo button. This perhaps explained why he was more at ease at work than in any social situation; opportunities to try things out and backpedal were thin on the ground there too.|I glanced at his terminal. He’d promised to analyse the past few days’ test results but that’s not what was on his screen. I sighed and then, when he paid no attention, I did it again only louder.|“I <i>can’t</i> help right now, Max,” he told me, thus proving he’d interpreted my exhalation correctly. “I’ve got to get on top of this financial stuff for the board before EOD. Reassure them that a delay isn’t going to impact our EBITDA given that <i>so far</i> all we’ve created is a new way to make a light flash on and off.”|He had a point. I couldn’t let him get away with that.|“But that’s a self-fulfilling vicious-circle type situation then, isn’t it?” I countered, tugging at the hem of my own lab coat in an overly optimistic attempt to straighten it. “We won’t ever finish the thing unless we put the time in. That makes it much harder — <i>impossible</i>, I’d say — to reassure the board that the delay won’t be a problem. Tell that to Ebit Dar, whoever that is — I assume another exec with no interest in the complexities of cutting edge technology.”|“EBITDA means money in. You know that. Mr. Nurgle has explained that plenty of times.”|Dougie referring to himself as Mr. Nurgle whenever we talked finance had been the norm for years. He wasn’t a great assistant but he was a mathematical wizard and it reminded me that it was better for him to be calling the financial shots than me. I admit I’d have preferred the two roles to have been fulfilled by different people but curiously sharing a lab with both Douglas Nurgle the not amazing assistant engineer and Douglas Nurgle the level-headed accountant worked just fine. As for how well they got by sharing a desk and a body I couldn’t hazard a guess.|Carrying on with a joke from a decade earlier also reassured me that my irregular — fine, regular — outbursts about his engineering prowess weren’t getting to him. He knew I didn’t mean it. Often he was right.|I dismantled the makeshift device, unable to tell what had ruptured by sight or aroma and wondering whether I should quickly knock up a gadget to determine burned-out components by scent, air temperature and smoke toxicity. No! Stop it! Maybe later.|I pulled a transistor from the nest of wires with my trusty tweezers. Pieces of its thin casing were splayed outwards as if some tiny creature had hatched from it. My extensive engineering knowledge informed me that creatures don’t hatch from electrical components, which left only the possibility that it had exploded. That could only have happened if something was wrong elsewhere in the unit. The transistor wasn’t the issue. It was the <i>victim</i>.|I removed a charred circuit board. There, right behind it, lurked the real problem. The exploder as opposed to the explodee. I glared at it.|“Dougie! DOUGIE!” I kept my eye on the innards of the machine as I shouted. “Dougie Dougie Dougie Doug Doug Doug-Doug-Doug, come here. What’s this?”|Dougie, having returned to his spreadsheets moments earlier, inhaled deeply. I considered apologising for the interruption but I was a stubborn old duffer. Not as old and stubborn as him, but close. Perhaps both were contagious. It was quite a small room.|“No!” my labmate snapped. “This is important! Why can’t you just tell me?”|Dougie’s outburst derailed both my meandering brainwander and the apology that I was definitely about to deliver. Perhaps doubting my ability to decode a request delivered with such rare brusqueness he regained a modicum of composure and reiterated it more softly.|“Just…”|I could sense that by leaving such a mammoth mid-sentence pause he was daring me to interrupt him again. I didn’t.|The pause continued.|Then it continued a little more.|Then I thought it was nearly over but it wasn’t and it kept going.|Then it finally ended.|“… tell me.”|“It’s a battery, Dougie. Shall I tell you what type of battery? Shall I? Dougie? It’s a three-E battery, Dougie. Way too powerful for these components. Why is there a three-E battery in here, Dougie? I didn’t say it needed a three-E battery. I said three… E batteries. Three batteries of the designation E, not one battery of the designation three-E. You blew up the machine, Dougie. Boom! I can’t believe you used a three-E! A three-E! Gnhhh! Infuriating.”|He remained silent for several seconds. He was clearly trying to stay calm and almost succeeding.|“You said three-E,” he quietly informed me.|“No I didn’t! I wouldn’t have said that because that’s not what it needed!” I spluttered on the smoke. “I pointed at the tubs and said ‘Get three E batteries’ and you grabbed a three-E battery. Come on, Dougie! Good grief.”|Dougie spun his chair, knocking a pot of pencils and a notepad from his desk.|“You said it needed power. Then you pointed right at the tub marked ‘three-E batteries’ and said ‘three-E batteries’ which is — well done — exactly what’s in the tub marked ‘three-E batteries’. Then…”|“I pointed at the wall!”|“No, pointing points at specific things, along a line. That’s why we point with fingers. They’re accurate. If I were to stick my finger in your ear you wouldn’t tell me to get my finger out of your whole… body.”|“First, ew. Second, <i>I didn’t stick my finger in the tub</i>. I pointed! It’s not the same thing.”|“It is just the same.”|“It’s not!”|“It is! It’s just… remoter. You have to extrapolate where the fingertip would be were the finger long enough to touch its target. Then it’s exactly the same.”|It was, I admit, a pretty good description of pointing.|“Oh my word, what a terrible description of pointing! Dougie, are you listening to yourself?”|“Yes, just like I was listening to you… when you said three-E.”|“Then you’re clearly <i>not</i> listening to yourself because you certainly weren’t listening to me when I said three — <i>and then a pause</i> — E.”|“Three-E.”|“Three… E! Three E!”|“We’re just saying the same thing now.”|“I know!” I snapped.|We stared at one another. There was no obvious next move for either of us. Stalemate.|A random thought flashed through my head, some advice that my father had given me on multiple occasions. The advice was this: <i>attributing blame won’t change what’s happened</i>. Also, attributing blame was proving tricky. Both of these were fantastic reasons to stop trying.|Dougie, perhaps having received the same advice from my father in the past or perhaps just reaching the same conclusion, grabbed the large wheels on the sides of his chair and propelled it, and himself, towards me. I stepped back, not wanting him to wheel his way onto one of my feet. He screeched to a halt — impressive given his incredibly slow speed — and took a look into the middle of the partially deconstructed machine.|“Oh, yeah,” he nodded. “That shouldn’t have been a three-E. Way too powerful.”|“Thanks, Dougie,” I deadpanned back, collapsing into a battered lab chair which creaked under the pressure. I fought to keep it from tipping over backwards on a particularly sticky carpet tile and caught my breath.|With our eyelines now level, Dougie and I exchanged worried glances for far longer than was comfortable. We were playing admitting-the-truth chicken. Dougie eventually broached the subject which means I won, but it was a hollow victory.|“We’re screwed then,” was his insight. “I’ll update the spreadsheet. Or maybe nuke the thing. It seems a bit redundant now.”|An involuntary shiver went down my spine — possibly a reaction to the word redundant.|“Dougie,” I asked, creaking to my feet and striding towards the lab’s wall-length window, “do you ever feel like there’s a finite number of inventions in you and you’ve reached that limit? Is it just me? Perhaps I should have paced myself better. If I hadn’t adapted that mini microwave to charge my music player whenever I was in the kitchen, maybe I’d still have another invention in me now. Don’t you miss being cutting edge? Smashing through the rules with a few bits of wire and some lateral thinking?”|“You can’t smash through rules. What does that even mean?”|“Fine. Creeping <i>towards</i> the limits of what science can achieve, then. Cracking complex conundrums and feeling like gods.”|He shook his head, his eyes closed.|“Really minor gods,” I conceded. “With soldering irons. We’re past it, Dougie. We’re gone. We can’t even get the batteries right.”|That thought stopped me in my tracks. Language was obviously an ineffective and error-prone way of transmitting ideas.|“Wait a second,” I instructed needlessly, given that Dougie was already stuck into a good session of doing very little. I spun on my right heel, scurried across the room to a cupboard chock-full of half-finished machinery and flung its double doors wide.|“Tell me you’ve just realised you can use some of the parts in there to remedy this,” called Dougie.|I chose to believe he was talking about the situation rather than the device, responded “Yes!” with a clearish conscience and began piling armfuls of machinery onto a nearby worktop.|“What are you looking for? Let me help — I’ve got a spreadsheet here explaining what’s where.” Of course he had. “Let me know what you’re after and I’ll tell you where to find it.”|I did. It was a long list.|“It does not,” he told me, “sound like you’re planning on fixing this machine at all.”|Rumbled.|“That’s because I have a better idea,” I confessed.|“Oh, come on, Max! The suits don’t want ideas! You can’t package ideas and put them in shops. They want <i>things</i>! Tangible, physical, functioning <i>things</i>! One project finished is better than one hundred started.”|A knock at the lab door made me jump and my armful of electronics fell and clattered to the floor. The door hissed open and a cheery face, along with its cheery owner, entered the room.|“Great,” I muttered under my breath. “Just great.”|“Hullo, lovely lab folks!” said the face. “How’s it all going?”"}
