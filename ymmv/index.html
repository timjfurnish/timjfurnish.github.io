He already has to find time for his headstrong teenage daughter Kira, catch the final episode of his favourite TV show and restart a potentially deadly work assignment. You know — small stuff.||Unfortunately for Max, the universe has other ideas.||So what — you’re probably not asking, although you should — does this have to do with a movie called 0v3rs33r? Where did The Butterfly Shrine come from? Who is Sar Bartholeryn of Mormaduke? Where can you buy dining chairs and sideboards and cupboard doors and desks and drawers? What is on the menu at Déjà Zoo? What in the world is a &lt;translation not found&gt;?||None of these questions will be answered unless you or someone within close proximity reads Cuckoobrain, an interstellar roadtrip of epic proportions and tangled dimensions.||After all, the universe may be messy but it’s the only one we’ve got (test results pending)."},
	["Chapter 1"]:{title:"A Calling", text:"It wasn’t the best of times. It wasn’t the worst of times. My life was what you could call fine. It was ok. A pessimist might say mediocre; an optimist, perfectly reasonable. It was, for all intents and purposes, alright.|“Dad, soldering iron! Thank you.”|However, and this is a big however, while the ripe old age of middle had treated me adequately it had not done wonders for my relationship with my daughter Kira. She — headstrong and wise beyond her years — and I — busy and often creaky — had been communicating less with each passing month. I could tell she was gearing up to make her own way in the world sooner rather than later. She mentioned it a <i>lot</i>.|Thankfully, tethering her to my approximation of a life was a newfound passion for building outlandish inventions. I knew it couldn’t keep her around forever, but if it bought me even a little extra time in her periodically delightful company I’d take it.|“Think that should hold. Is that paper in properly? Then why’s the camera not locking on?”|Inventing stuff was a pastime — a calling, even — that I’d picked up from my own father. (I don’t fully understand the mechanism by which parental hobbies are inherited alongside eye colour and hairline; had we been geneticists rather than engineers that may have been different.)|“This is precisely why I said we should get a new lens. I told you this one was scratched. Feed it a file instead. I’ve got some on this thing if you need one.”|When I wasn’t inventing at home or pouring my daylight hours into my job I dreamed of adventure. Fortunately, the adventures stayed within the boundaries of my unconscious mind. I didn’t need an adventure at my age: my joints had started aching and I was settled into a thoroughly manageable routine, thank you very much.|“Ok, so it can’t read files. And I’ve wiped the lens but now the page flipper’s jamming so it can’t do paper either. Maybe we should… wait! It was misaligned! Pass me the rest. I’m going to lean a chair on it so it doesn’t move about any more.”|The universe, however, does not have a great track record when it comes to playing along with its occupants’ desires for stability. Maybe it fears that constancy leads to stagnation. The universe, I find, has much the same personality as a bored teenager — regularly reinventing itself, rearranging its bedroom furniture or upending its perfectly functional laws of thermodynamics rather than carry on looking or living or operating like <i>this</i> any longer, <i>ugh</i>.|It stands to reason that a universe can break a whole bunch of foundation-level rules that its denizens cannot; that’s certainly the case in most organisations. It would also explain the existence of black holes, time dilation, the double slit experiment and car keys which sit patiently by your front door for days but then teleport into an upstairs drawer the second you need to drive somewhere.|“There we go! Can we tell if it’s working or do we need to wait until it’s done? Really? Where? Ah, yeah! Look at that! Right, let’s leave it running and get going. I’m hungry. Yes, it’s amazing but you can’t sit watching it. Food!”|There was a time when the universe and I got on just fine. When all I had to worry about was my career at the lab and my wonderful daughter and the potentially deadly work assignment I’d been handed. You know — small stuff.|“Dad, come on! I don’t want to miss the table and we can talk about what we’re going to build next.”|And then it all went a bit &lt;translation not found&gt;."},
