Letter"]:"I write you this message|My dear darling wife|To say I’m so glad|I’ll be spending my life|With someone so wonderful|Headstrong and witty|Clever, considerate|Charming and pretty|Our love is so magical|Pure and profound|My heart’s doing cartwheels|I’m so pleased I found|Such a soulmate, a friend|And companion and so|I’m leaving to be with her|Thought you should know",	["The Hotness"]:"The temperature is rising|Even with the windows open|So we turn on all the desk fans|And we use a tad more power|So the stations all work harder|Pumping smoke into the air|So the temperature is rising||We like our air conditioned|While we’re driving with the roof down|So we burn a bit more petrol|So we have to take a detour|To fill up the thirsty fuel tank|And we sit there on the forecourt|But it’s baking in the sunshine|So we like our air conditioned||And looking down upon us|Quips God unto St. Michael|They had to drive the soft-top|‘Cos they couldn’t break the cycle",	["Hey Kid - It's Nearly Halloween"]:"Hey, kid - it’s nearly Halloween|We had a spooky day|With vampires, ghosts and zombie clowns|A million grins and zero frowns|With living scarecrows, mummies too|We had a great day, me and you|I’m sorry that it had to end|And there’s one thing I must commend|I’m glad you know it’s all pretend|And it’s all meant in play||You were not timid in the least |You laughed and chatted with each beast|With horns or wig upon its head|You screamed and jumped but never fled|This creepy day, this eerie night|I’m pleased how much you understand|There is no need to cry or fight|To hide or run away||The monsters|Are people||And I’ll continue to conceal|The truth about the world from you|And will pretend for both our sakes|That beasts and monsters are not real||Hey kid - it’s nearly Halloween|And demons are just paint and cloaks|And tales of pain and death are jokes|The scars are ink and wounds are goo|And you don’t need to know right now|That beasts are real and monsters too|I hope they never come for you|Although I know they may||The monsters|Are people||That’s why we all love Halloween|We practice standing up to fear|It’s only for a week each year|We kid ourselves that all the beasts|And all the monsters disappear|When cloaks and horns and masks are boxed|And paint is wiped away",	["Ok Boomer"]:"Well I've heard your bile and your so-called jokes|Your vile distain for modern folks|Refusing to approve your sense of humour|And those who help their fellow man|Are undermining every plan|You’ve made to accrue riches, ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer||You threaten kids who want to save|The world and travel wave by wave|Upon the face of Earth you are a tumour|A shame you’ll never get to see|The mess you’ve made and left for me|The future’s fucked and far from ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer||Your apathy closed factories|You sit or lie as each nurse flees|You’re tripling the price of a satsuma|You’ll save the banks and start a war|God only knows what fucking for|You only care that you’ll be ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer||I pray to God that I am wrong|That all the words within this song|Are paranoia from a doom-and-gloomer|With all my heart I doubt you’re right|But if in fact the future’s bright|I’ll eat my words, I trust that’s ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer||But it’s too late: you can’t deny|The temperatures and tides are high|The fires are on the news, not just a rumour|To watch you throw your shutters wide|The cries like sunlight flood inside|10 billion people chanting ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|Ok boomer|#okboomer",	["Ode To Things I'm Sick Of|Seeing On My Social Media|News Feed"]:"I do not care how far you ran|How much you think like Spiderman|Or what you scored in any quiz|Or what your BMI now is|What bands you've played the most this week|In which locales you took a leak|How many classic books you've read|What weight you lift above your head|How fast you drive or price of fuel|The time spent taking kids to school|The score in any football match|The extra time they added, natch|How cold the air is (or how hot)|How many birthday cards you got|The followers you've gained or lost|Or how much your insurance cost|Please, make me think or cry or laugh|Don't tell me things that I can graph|It's \"update status\" dude, not \"stats\"|To agree, like and share and post pictures of cats",	["Something About Snowflakes"]:"Chestnuts banned because of allergies|Jill Frost nipping at your bits|Yuletide carols sung and signed by a choir|And folks dressed up like Inuits|We all know that it's|A mushroom steak and mistletoe|That helps to make the season bright|Tiny tots tracking sleighs on their phones|Will find it hard to sleep tonight||They know that Kwanza's on its way|And winter solstice, Hanukkah and Christmas Day|And every pagan child will hunt each store|But there are no Saturnalia cards any more||And so I'm offering this simple phrase|To folks excited and ambivalent|Although it's been said many times many ways|Happy Holidays or equivalent"}function MakeButtonBar(cmd,text){	return
